# GUI in Rust 2019

The `Rust 2018` journey has been great so far, both as a year filled up with great features to the core language, its improvements in the ecosystem and its first fully fleshed out Edition ðŸŽ‰. As the year 2018 slowly comes to its end we're once more [encouraged to Blog about the things we'd like to see in 2019](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2018/12/06/call-for-rust-2019-roadmap-blogposts.html)

I have many things i'd like to see in the upcoming year and to bring it home its mostly the same thing i've read in other posts on reddit and/or Blogposts: 

> I will finish what you started

But you might have guessed this is not really what this post is about! I want to takle one specific topic in contrast to other posts that are mostly from a different perspective and want to paint the "Big Picture" and overall direction. This post is about the narrow topic GUI and i want to make a case to convince, at least a fraction of the community that is interested in this field, that it might be a good idea to invest in this direction.

## where are we now?

It is not the case that its impossible to write a GUI for your Rust application. But you really have to think about in what direction you want to go and through what hurdles you want to jump. 

### Native approach

- windows
  - rust as background process/library IPC to C/C++ frontend (xi-editor)
  - win api + ffi
  - [nwg](https://github.com/gabdube/native-windows-gui) [crate](https://crates.io/crates/native-windows-gui)
- macOS
  - rust as background process/library IPC to ObjC/Swift frontend (xi-editor)
  - [cocoa-rs](https://github.com/servo/core-foundation-rs/tree/master/cocoa)
- linux
  - x

### Cross Platform Toolkits
- Qt
  - like native with ICP/FFI and a C/C++/Python... frontend
  - [qt rust binding generator](https://www.vandenoever.info/blog/2018/09/16/browsing_your_mail_with_rust_and_qt.html), qmetaobject, (dead?) qml-rs, qml-rust ...
- Gtk
  - like native with IPC/FFI and C/Vala... frontend
  - Gtk-rs
  - relm
- wx, libui/iui ...

Problems: does not feel "rusty" atm

### (name?) Rust Centric
- many dead
  - indigo
  - limn
  - rsx
  - many more ...
- [Azul](https://azul.rs/)
- [orbTk](https://gitlab.redox-os.org/redox-os/orbtk)

## we don't want
- core team to code a GUI framework
- ...

## we do want
- discussion
- help
  - a leader
  - a place to come together
