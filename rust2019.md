# GUI in Rust 2019

The `Rust 2018` journey has been great so far, both as a year filled up with great features to the core language, its improvements in the ecosystem and its first fully fleshed out Edition 🎉. As the year 2018 slowly comes to its end we're once more [encouraged to Blog about the things we'd like to see in 2019](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2018/12/06/call-for-rust-2019-roadmap-blogposts.html)

I have many things i'd like to see in the upcoming year and to bring it home its mostly the same thing i've read in other posts on reddit and/or Blogposts: 

> I will finish what you started    

-- *Ben Solo aka Kylo Ren*

But you might have guessed this is not really what this post is about! I want to tackle one specific topic in contrast to other posts that are mostly from a different perspective and want to paint the "Big Picture" and overall direction. This post is about the narrow topic GUI and i want to make a case to convince, at least a fraction of the community that is interested in this field, that it might be a good idea to invest in this direction.

## where are we now?

It is not the case that its impossible to write a GUI for your Rust application. But you really have to think about in what direction you want to go and through what hurdles you want to jump. 

### Native approach
- windows
  - rust as background process/library IPC to C/C++ frontend (xi-editor)
  - win api + ffi
  - [nwg](https://github.com/gabdube/native-windows-gui) [crate](https://crates.io/crates/native-windows-gui)
- macOS
  - rust as background process/library IPC to ObjC/Swift frontend (xi-editor)
  - [cocoa-rs](https://github.com/servo/core-foundation-rs/tree/master/cocoa)
- linux
  - x

### Cross Platform Toolkits
As we've seen the native approach can be quite involved, especially if you want to target multiple platforms. It is nonetheless the best way to have acchieve the best experience on a particular platform. If your constraints are not that high and you want to save some development time 
- Qt
  - like native with ICP/FFI and a C/C++/Python... frontend
  - [qt rust binding generator](https://www.vandenoever.info/blog/2018/09/16/browsing_your_mail_with_rust_and_qt.html), qmetaobject, (dead?) qml-rs, qml-rust ...
- Gtk
  - like native with IPC/FFI and C/Vala... frontend
  - Gtk-rs
  - relm
- wx, libui/iui ...

Problems: does not feel "rusty" atm

### (name?) Rust Centric
- many dead
  - indigo
  - limn
  - rsx
  - many more ...
- [Azul](https://azul.rs/)
- [orbTk](https://gitlab.redox-os.org/redox-os/orbtk)

## who needs GUI in the Rust-World?

This years [survey](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2018/11/27/Rust-survey-2018.html) told us that there is a demand for GUI.
### Nr.8 in the Survey 
https://blog.rust-lang.org/2018/11/27/Rust-survey-2018.html#challenges
> New this year is the rising need to support GUI development, showing that Rust continues to grow not only on the server, but that people are feeling the need to stretch into application development.

We also have some #Rust2019 blogpost explicitly talking about GUI

### blogposts that mention GUI

> a workable cross-platform GUI library that abstracts over the smallest, most thrifty platform libraries (sort of like a reduced FLTK, but with the components written in and for Rust and backends for Windows, MacOS, X11, Wayland, Android, iOS, perhaps WASM?)

>There are lots of other cool GUI projects out there too. I personally feel Azul is one of the most promising, as I think WebRender is a good basis for building GUI. But there are things to be learned from Conrod, ggez, as well as wrappers for toolkits in other languages.
It’s not surprising that much of the activity on GUI in Rust has a focus on games, and I think that’s a good thing.


As a regular [r/rust](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/) visitor i have seen a surprising amount of posts asking about the status of gui development. I wanted to keep track of it but at some point i just lost track but here is a smal excerpt – i think you get the idea.

## reddit posts

> I guess a cross-platform native GUI library with also WebAssembly in mind, would be a good focus. And by cross-platform I mean like PC+embedded+web+mobile cross-platform :)

> I would personally love to see a better desktop GUI story. While I haven't kept up with the current state of the libraries, my impression is that they are still immature or unidiomatic, which is usually a result of most popular GUI toolkits having an OOP design that doesn't mesh well with rusts design philosophy.

https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/a0hijk/does_rust_have_a_working_gui_library_group/
>  I wonder if rust needs a group where some GUI experts and a few PL researchers can come together and decide how to make a Libra which is idiomatic rust and yet does only the bare minimum in the cross platform sense. Taking inspiration from how xamarin, silver (elements), sublime, gtk, qt etc do it.

> A while ago I was playing around with Webrender to experiment with doing a Flutter/React-type UI library. It's quite a steep challenge so I didn't get that far. I used a binding to Facebook's Yoga library to handle layout.

> What is currently the best options for GUI programming with Rust ?
I'm looking for the best option to make a gui program, but it's seems that there is multiples alternatives, i want something easy to use, what do you advise me ?

https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/6qr11b/are_we_crossplatform_native_gui_yet/
> Are we cross-platform native GUI yet?
What is the current state of writing a native GUI app in Rust that could run on (at least) Windows and Linux, unmodified if possible? (I'd like to avoid electron and the like).

https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/6psav3/rust_library_for_declarative_nonnative_guis/
> I was wondering what would be the Rust native means of accomplishing a complex "non-native" GUI like this one? It seems like Conrod is heading in that direction and development is very active, but there isn't a lot of documentation outside the examples.

> I need to GUI framework.
Hello here. Is there any GUI framework for Rust lang. Thanks beforehand.

https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/6thjci/gui_crates_and_options/
> GUI crates and options?
Hey Rustaceans,
I was wondering, what is the current milieu around GUI libraries? What is the standard for composing GUI applications, and what tools/crates should I be looking for?

I just found this Ultralight framework that seems to provide a lighter weight alternative to chromium embeddings.

This is just to show you what its feels like on the rust subreddit, if you're not a regular visitor. But of course this is just one side and you could argue that those are just "random" questions from people who want to "play" around with the topic but this is not really i sign for real world demand. To try to give some examples for more "real world" need i have chosen to give some examples from projects i loosely follow:

- [system76](https://system76.com/) uses some Rust for their tooling and from some developers i heard that there is a demand in GUI applications. One of their tools is [popsicle](https://github.com/pop-os/popsicle) a tool to flash multiple USB devices in parallel.
      
- The [Redox-OS](https://redox-os.org/) Project tries to – very successfully – build an entier Operating System in Rust from scratch. This also includes the GUI part. The current manifestation of this is the discussed [OrbTk](https://gitlab.redox-os.org/redox-os/orbtk). I think you can imagine that a desktop operating system has a hight demand in GUI related applications. 

- The [Amethyst](https://www.amethyst.rs/) Project tries to build a game engine written in Rust. They recently started an effort to [explore](https://community.amethyst-engine.org/t/exploring-possible-ui-toolkits-for-the-editor) the possibilities to build an Editor.     

## previous attempts 
We saw previous attemps to gather together people on multiple occasion but all of them slowly faded after the initial start.  
- [internals thread](https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/thoughts-on-rust-guis/)
- [gui wg gitter](https://gitter.im/rust-gui-wg/Lobby)


## we don't want
We don't want the core Team to build or settle on a GUI framework. This is without question absolutely out of scope. GUI is hard and we have seen many attemps in different directions. It is very unclear what "The Rust GUI" should even look like. And i think it is very clear that we don't want the "only true" Rust GUI Framework. I also think that we don't want something like a official Workgroup. At least for now. The main reason for this is that currently we have many "one person" attempts to find a way through the jungle of possible technologies and thus it does not make sense to have some direct governence. 

## we do want
- discussion
- help
  - leadership
  - a place to come together
- bikeshed ideas
- help the projects currently existing
