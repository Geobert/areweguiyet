> I would personally love to see a better desktop GUI story. While I haven't kept up with the current state of the libraries, my impression is that they are still immature or unidiomatic, which is usually a result of most popular GUI toolkits having an OOP design that doesn't mesh well with rusts design philosophy.

Taking inspiration from how xamarin, silver (elements), sublime, gtk, qt etc do it.

What is the current state of writing a native GUI app in Rust that could run on (at least) Windows and Linux, unmodified if possible? (I'd like to avoid electron and the like).

Hey Rustaceans,
I was wondering, what is the current milieu around GUI libraries? What is the standard for composing GUI applications, and what tools/crates should I be looking for?
